# Armstrong Numbers Challenge

## Problem statement

A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cube of all digits of the number is equal to the number itself. For example:

3³ + 7³ + 1³ = 371

4³ + 0³ + 7³ = 343

Create a function that satisfies the following [test cases](armstrong_test.go).

Run tests with:

```bash
cd challenges
go test ../challenges/armstrongnumbers/
```
