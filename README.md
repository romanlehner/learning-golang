## learn go with tests
From one of the most well written sources that I ever found for learning programming by [Chris James](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

### structs
The structs exersice is a simple demonstration of structs, methods, interfaces and using tables for test cases.

Test run:
```bash
cd learn-go-with-tests
go test ../learn-go-with-tests/structs
```

## personal notes
- There can only be one package per folder
- Go interfaces are implicit
